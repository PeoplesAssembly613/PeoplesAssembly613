Our block on Bank Street - between Lisgar and Nepean - has been targeted for demolition. We formed Bank Block Tenants to save our homes. We’re fighting back against the investors seeking to displace us.

Centretown still has 1000s of units similar to ours. But the vultures are circling in. The block immediately south of us on Bank is also fighting a planned mass eviction. Currently there is no way to replace these units when they are destroyed. Quite intentionally, the City no longer even uses language to describe precisely what is being systematically eliminated. Rent-controlled housing accessible for low-income households, including families.

Instead we hear about the affordable housing on deck. Affordable for whom? Seniors on basic pension? ODSP recipients? Ontario Works? The vast majority of students? Emerging artists? Workers earning min wage? $25/hr? No. 

Investors and their junior partners at the City are trying to re-shape our city in the interests of profit. In fighting to keep our homes, we are asserting that these changes are not inevitable, and that a less fearful, and more interesting and joyful city is still possible. One where regular working people can count on stable housing through our working years and into retirement.

The Rockcliffe Park households of the investor families targeting our block would immediately grind to a halt if it weren’t for the constant labour of workers - at rock bottom wages whenever possible. We make their food, deliver their food, take care of their children - and parents. We clean their homes, clean their pools, remodel their homes, and on and on and on.

In return these investors collude with one another to systematically destroy our rent-controlled homes, and price us out of the city, or onto the street.

Similar to workers in a shop getting organized to confront a boss, we as tenants get meaningful concessions when we confront these investors directly. And we’ve learned over the months of
unresponsiveness from the investors on our block, that in order to get their attention, we must increase the costs of eviction. 

If an investor wants to kick us out onto the street, should he also be practicing as a cardiologist? No. Should a married partner of an investor be having her salary paid by UofO and Carleton students in her position at World University Services Canada? No.

Palatable side roles in society need to become off limits for investors who profit from the displacement and immiseration of working class tenants. No more image-laundering garnishes. We need to silo these investors in the misery of their wealth accumulation.

Would you like to help defend your neighbourhood, and directly interfere with the investments that are putting you and your neighbours at risk of displacement? Please get in touch with BBT or NOC.
