<p>We are coming together to build a People's Assembly on housing, in order to serve as a forum for local tenants to share our experiences and as a platform to fight for an end to the exploitative housing system.</p>

<p>This Assembly is for those of us who have seen our incomes siphoned away by rent payments, who have seen homeownership fall farther away, and who live every day with the threat of eviction hanging over our heads.</p>

<p>The commodification that has caused the housing crisis is not a flaw within the current system, but is one of its key features. The ruling class has turned human beings' need for shelter into profit. </p>

<p>As ordinary working people, we need to build a movement to strike at the root causes of this rotten system. It's time to stop waiting around for elected politicians and established parties to fail us again. We can build our own power, building by building and block by block. The People's Assembly will serve to help support tenants getting in organized, fight for control over their housing and to link up with other struggles against exploitation. </p>

<p>The ruling class has engineered the housing crisis, and working people are feeling the consequences. The powerful will not go against their own interests. It is time for us to take action.</p>
