<p>Our Turn is a project dedicated to highlighting the struggles faced by working people and tenants, and bringing attention to the ways that ordinary people can get organized and fight for something better. We will publish articles telling the stories of tenants and workers in their struggles against injustice, and analyzing developments in our community and elsewhere. 

<p>In an era when Ottawa and other cities are being devastated by a system that turns human needs into private profit, it is more important than ever to build solidarity among ordinary people. We hope that Our Turn can be a forum for tenants and working people to share our experiences, develop our collective understanding, and strengthen our sense of community. </p>

<p>While the majority of the articles published in Our Turn will likely be geared towards the community in which we are located (downtown Ottawa broadly and Centretown West in particular), we are also happy to publish articles focused on tenant struggles in other cities. Our movements will be stronger if we can learn from one another and connect with other working people across the country, and across national borders. The system which has created the housing crisis is international in scope. The movement opposing it should be international as well.
